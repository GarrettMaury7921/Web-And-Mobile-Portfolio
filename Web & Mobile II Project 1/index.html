					<p>
						Old Ellicott City is one of Maryland's most historic districts located near the Tiber and Patapsco rivers.
						It is home to a very old railroad and milling homes, using the water from the rivers to help support the town in 1772 when it was founded.
					</p>
					<p>
						Downtown Ellicott City, where all of these attractions are placed, are often called "Historic Ellicott City" or "Old Ellicott City".
						The railroads became part of the B&O railroad, making the location a very important place for the state back in the day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nowadays, there are still a lot of remnants of the railroads, trains, and mills. Although, it is mainly a historic little
						attraction in Maryland with a lot of dining locations and street venues. Old Ellicott City is now also known for the floods 
						that have affected the area for the past couple years, completely destroying many areas due to the very close rivers surrounding it. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Some parts of Old Ellicott City became tourist attractions because it is labeled as one of the most haunted small towns on the east coast.
						There is a ghost tour that brings tourists and other people alike to see the towns most haunted locations where there have been reports
						of various paranormal activity!
					</p>
