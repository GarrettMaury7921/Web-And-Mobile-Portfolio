						Milling was an important part of Old Ellicott City as there are some mills located within the town.
						Although, the log cabin that you see in the picture on this page has been relocated because of the recent
						floods to affect the area, streets, and the town altogether. Several mills were built in the 1700s on the banks
						of the Patapsco River.

					<p>
						In 1766, the "Maryland Mill Act of 1669" to take 20 acres of land right next to the river. The mills were built near the banks of the rivers.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this picture, you can see a small bridge located under the B&O railroad bridge, with the Patapsco River flowing beneath. 
						During flooding, the water easily goes into the town. 
						Many Marylanders hear about the flooding in Old Ellicott City about every severe rain storm.
					</p>
					<p>
						<br><br><br>
						Ellicott City is named after the "Ellicott Brothers" who made farming in the area more mainstream by
						constructing mills, smithies, and oil mill stations. One important point is that Maryland was known
						for planting a lot of tobacco. Although, the Ellicott brothers also constructed grain mills which caused
						the area to plant wheat instead of tobacco.

						alt="A picture showing the geographical location of old Ellicott city with a flood map." />
					<p>
						Ellicott City geographically is located to the northeast of the Patapsco River. This part of the state forms the Baltimore County line.
						Ellicott City is built on several hills in the district. Several of these hills are near the Tiber River valley and west of the Patapsco River.
						Near Main Street, it forms a small valley. A pretty unlucky circumstance when the area has a flood. This multiplies the chances of flooding in the area
						and increases the severity of destruction when it occurs.
