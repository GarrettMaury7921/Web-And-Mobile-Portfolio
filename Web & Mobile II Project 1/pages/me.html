					<h2>My experience in Old Ellicott City.</h2>
					<p>
						I've been to Old Ellicott City many times before. The first time I've been there was on a school trip to La Palapa for spanish class in high school.
						I was a student at Mount Saint Joseph High School. A school located in Baltimore. For our Honors Spanish III class, they would take the class
						to La Palapa to have some food for a field trip and to possibly see students speak to people in spanish.
					</p>

					<p>
						During our time there, we got some good food and enjoyed all the shops around the area. One of my favorite areas is a games workshop store.
						It was not an official 'games workshop' store. It was a store for a ton of vintage, modern board, and card games that you could buy.
						It is called Gamers Corp.
					</p>

					<h2>About me Now:</h2>

						Why Old Ellicott City: I came to the town as a kid and I really enjoy the train part of the town.
						My family, mainly my grandfather was really into trains and as a kid I was also really into trains.
						It was really cool for me to sometimes see some abandoned cabooses when I was exploring the town.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes my parents and I would bike down to Old Ellicott City from home since we live nearby.
						If you're lucky, you might be able to see the CSX train come by on some nearby tracks!
					</p>
					<p>
						It was kind of funny when I was there in high school the train came by, the tracks are pretty much right near the roads
						and while the train came by literally everyone in the class would cover their ears because of the sheer noise
						the train would make coming down through the tracks. One thing I remember is that the train seemed to have infinite
						other cars and units on it when it went by! The train is really long!
