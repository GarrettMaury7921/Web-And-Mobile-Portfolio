					<h2>Flooding in Old Ellicott City.</h2>
					<hr >

					<!-- Topic 1 -->
					<h2>2016 Flood</h2>
					<img class="pic" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/flood1.png" width="350" height="250" alt="A header picture showing a flood affecting the city." />
					<p>
						During this time, it was a severe thunderstorm that affected the area heavily. It is now considered a national disaster for the town.
						This storm had six inches of rain in the span of two hours. It was considered a flash flood that affected Main Street, 
						a street that goes straight through Old Ellicott City. The Governor of Maryland declared a state of emergency for the area during the time of the storm.
						Many things were destroyed including the landmark clock. Two people also died during the storm.
					</p>
					<p>
						This picture shows a residence home being destroyed after the storm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Main Street had been closed after the storm. This part of the town was closed for about two months. Many businesses, residences, and shops had
						to clean up everything after the storm happened. The street and the town reopened on October 6th, 2016. This rebuilding process for the
						town became the norm since floods happen every few years. 
					</p>

					<!-- Topic 2 -->
					<h2>2018 Flood</h2>
					<img class="pic" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/flood2.png" width="350" height="250" alt="A header picture showing another flood affecting the city." />
					<p>
						Compared to the 2016 flood, this flood poured down eight inches of rain in the span of two hours. The town had built
						a new flooding emergency system. But this flood happened right before it was finished. During this flood there was
						also another state of emergency. National Guardsman Sgt. Eddison Hermond was declared dead after the storm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buildings were demolished during this storm, and streets were flooded while cars were being swept away by the water. 
						The water level of the Patapsco river, the river right near Main Street was reported to have a water level increase of 17 feet!
					</p>

					<!-- Topic 3 -->
					<h2>Plans for Floods</h2>
					<p>
						The Ellicott City Watershed Master Plan was revealed to the public in 2017. Unfortunately due to the flood in 2018, the plan had to be thought over again.
						This is important since one hundred and forty million dollars was put into the plan by county officials to try to stop the floods from happening.
						Although, some of these plans involve removing historic landmarks, which can be quite controversial.
