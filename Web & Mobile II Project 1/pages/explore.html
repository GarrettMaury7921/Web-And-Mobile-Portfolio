					<h2>Milling!</h2>

					<!-- Leading Picture (Topic 1) -->
					<img class="pic" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/mill.png" width="300" height="200" alt="A picture showing a mill located in Old Ellicott City." />
					<p>
						Milling is a popular attraction because there still stands some very old log cabins and milling stations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some stations have been relocated because of the floods but overall it is a nice historic attraction if any visitor is into
						the history of Maryland and Old Ellicott City.
					</p>
					<p>
						The picture of the log cabin here is called the Thomas Isaac log cabin. This landmark was believed to be built around the 1780s.
						This specific landmark was relocated due to flooding.
					</p>
						<br><br><br>
						
					<h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
					<p>
						There is a story of the "Upper Mills" where the mills were sold to Joseph Ellicott in 1774. The story goes to say that the B&O railroad
						later in time ended up going through where the mills originally were. The track of the B&O railroad went through the graves of the family 
						that sold the mill to Joseph Ellicott (Hood Family). There are a lot of ghost attractions and stories related to Old Ellicott City as well!
					</p>

					<!-- Leading Picture (Topic 2) -->
					<h2>Railroads!</h2>
					<img class="pic_left" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/bridge.png" width="300" height="200" alt="A picture showing the B&O railroad bridge in Old Ellicott City." />
					<p>
						Railroads are a big attraction since there is the B&O railroad bridge that goes right over main street. There are many train cars still located within
						the town, most are unusable and abandoned. There are train ride tickets that are sold to visitors. They are sold on a first come first served basis.
						<br><br><br>
					</p>

					<!-- Leading Picture (Topic 3) -->
					<img class="pic" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/station.png" width="300" height="200" alt="A picture showing the B&O railroad bridge in Old Ellicott City." />
					<p>
						This is a picture of a very old station on the right, which was taken in 1970.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mills were the first "terminus" of the B&O railroad which was located outside of Baltimore. Making it another very historic landmark
						for tourists and visitors alike. Kids might enjoy the trains as there might be old abandoned train cars located in other places in the 
						town that are not on the track.
						<br><br><br><br><br><br>

					<!-- Leading Picture (Topic 4) -->
					<img class="pic" src="https://people.rit.edu/ggm7921/ISTE240/project1/assets/imgs/flood_stages.png" width="220" height="380" alt="A picture showing the marks of how high the water was on the B&O bridge." />
					<h2>Flooding in Old Ellicott City</h2>
					<p>
						In recent times, flooding has been a very important part of Old Ellicott City since it is located near two rivers.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the picture, you can see that there are water marks on the B&O bridge. The floods that Old Ellicott City get are extremely 
						dangerous and the entire town has been rebuilt again and again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many in the town try to preserve the history, many landmarks have been relocated because of the floods.
