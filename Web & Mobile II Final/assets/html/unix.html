    Unix is a family of operating systems developed by the Bell Labs Research Center in the 1960s. This technology was
    one of the fathers of modern computing interfaces.
    An operating system is a combination of programs that mix together to make the computers that we use today. The
    computer that you are reading this website on is using its own type of operating system.
    Unix systems usually have a user interface that lets you click on the different programs that you want to use. Much
    like your do on your computer at home.
    However, to make use of all that Unix has to offer, its important to learn some of the commands to tell the computer
    what you want to do. We will talk about more of this later.
    <br><br>

    There are lots of different types of Unix computers. However, to make things easy, they all share important
    similarities. You might have heard of operating systems like Linux or Mac.
    Both of these are built on the same system that Unix uses.

<h4 class="content">Origin</h4>
<p class="content">
	UNIX, a shortened version of UNICS (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) was born 
    from the failing development of MULTICS (Multiplexed Operating and Computing System) in 1969.
    MULTICS was supposed to be a time-sharing operating system, meaning multiple users could use 
    and process the data simultaneously. However, there were various obstacles and the project became far 
    more complex. It wasn't until the computer scientists' employer pulled the plug and ended the development
    of MULTICS. The computer scientists who tried to develop MULTICS to decided to make a simpler
    operating system called UNIX.
<br>
	Since then, many different UNIX and UNIX-Like operating systems emerged such as Android, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and so on have become integral parts of the technology we have today.
