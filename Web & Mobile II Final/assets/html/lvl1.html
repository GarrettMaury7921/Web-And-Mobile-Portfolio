    There are some fundamental parts that are the same for all Unix based computers.

    <h3 class="content-small-header"> The Kernel </h3><br>

    <!-- Content -->
    <p class="content">
        The kernel is one of the hardest parts of Unix to understand. So don’t worry! However, it is important to pay
        attention because the kernel is the main part of the operating system that does most of the work.
        This is because the kernel is the boss of the computer. It organizes all the activities that the computer does
        and makes sure that there is time and space allotted for everything to get done.
        It does this through handing out computer memory for the programs to use and store anything they want to save.
        It also handles all the saved files on the computer and can bring them up when your computer
        asks for them. Whenever you run a program, make a file or remove a file the kernel is the boss that gets the job
        done.

        <p class="caption">*This diagram helps to visualize the job that the kernel does. It’s the boundary between the
            machines that make the computer run (CPU, Memory, Devices) and the programs that use the computer
            to do cool stuff. So if you want to use one of your favorite videogames on a Unix system, that videogame
            will use the kernel to ask for all the parts of the computer that it needs to make the game work!</p>

    <h3 class="content-small-header"> The Shell </h3><br>

    <!-- Content -->
    <p class="content">The shell is also a very important part of the Unix system. It is the interface between the
        person using the computer and the kernel described above.
        That’s because the shell takes the commands that the person using the computer writes and gives them to the
        kernel to make them happen. This is because the shell is a command line interpreter.
        Its job is to take in the commands and then help the kernel make sense of them. It would be very difficult
        to
        talk to the kernel directly because it uses a very strange language to carry out its work.
        Thankfully, the shell can take human words and translate them so that the kernel can understand what we
        want.

        <p class="caption">*This is an example of three different types of Unix operating systems and their shells. As
            you can see, the shell is just a line of words on a black screen. It waits for you to type in a command then
            it uses the kernel to do what the command says.</p>

<h4 class="content-subheader" id="file-system"> File System </h4>

<div class="wrapper">
    <!-- Small content subheader -->
    <p class="content">The Unix system uses a strict file system to keep everything organized on the computer. Much like
        a file cabinet, any time you want to save some information, you label your papers and folders and save them in
        an organized manner. This makes it super easy to find all the information you need later on. Similarly, the Unix
        file system follows the same method. It has specific folders that come with the same information in it every
        time you download Unix and use it on your computer. These files, and the data inside them, have all the things
        the operating system needs to run properly. Because of this, the files are in the same spot every time. If you
        ever moved one of these files, your computer might not work how its supposed to. But, the filesystem is the
        place for you to save all the stuff that you might be working on for school or save your progress in a game your
        playing. You can make your own folder to save your information. Or you can make multiple folders to keep a more
        organized structure.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="body-img">
        <img src="../assets/images/File_1.png" alt="file">
        <p class="caption">*This is what the file structure looks like. The squares in the green box are all the
            important
            folders that the operating system comes with when you download it. You can make your own folders like what
            is
            shown in the blue box.</p>

<h4 class="content-subheader" id="navigation"> Navigation </h4>


<div class="wrapper-alt">
    <p class="content navgrid" style="grid-column: 1 / span 5; text-align: center;">It is important to know how to use
        the shell to navigate through the file system we just
        learned about. In most computers you can click on the folder you want to use and click on the
        files inside of it. But in Unix, sometimes it is better to write commands into the shell rather than
        clicking on the screen. 
        <br><br>
        <p class ="content" style="font-style: italic; grid-column: 1 / span 5; text-align: center;">Here are some commands that you can use:</p></p>

    <p class="content navgrid"><code>ls</code>This command is used to show all the files/folders in the folder
        you’re using.</p>

    <img class="navgrid-img" src="../assets/images/ls.png" alt="ls">

    <p class="content navgrid"><code>pwd</code>This command is used to show the path to get to the folder that
        you’re using. The path is the folders that you must go through to find the folder
        that you’re currently in.</p>

    <img class="navgrid-img" src="../assets/images/pwd.png" alt="pwd">
    <p class="content navgrid"><code>cd</code>This command is used to change from the current folder into
        another one. If you want to leave the folder that your in you just use the command “cd ..”</p>
