My Reflection on Project 3
Garrett Maury

For my Web and Mobile Project 3, I think one of the best features is the navigation header that the user
will always see in the website. This allows for continuous navigation. I also think that there is a good amount
of pictures to keep the content engaging and fun. The type set and colors I had for this website were basic,
but I wanted to have that "RIT" color palette throughout the website. Additionally, I made a custom background
picture that has paw prints embedded into the design. I think that the addition will keep my content unique while
still keeping the school spirit.

Some things that I thought this website needed improvement was the margins and positioning of content. Overall
I think I did a good job with the media queries. But in some windows some content is not in the center. If I
were to make this website again I think I would have to rethink the code design. This website over time got harder
and harder to deal with. Sometimes the grid's would bug out or not work entirely probably because I made the website
in a weird way.

Overall, I think this website came out really good and I am happy that the theme turned out well!
