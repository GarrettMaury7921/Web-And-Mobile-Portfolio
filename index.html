                        Introduction: My name is Garrett Maury and I am a Second Year CIT student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am currently studying computer networking and computing security. I am
                        really excited to be studying important and impactful computing topics that play a huge role in our every day lives. In my free time I like to code AI and Machine Learning models that
                        can do or play various things on the computer! If you would like to check out my personal projects related to any of these topics, check out my<a href="https://github.com/GarrettMaury7921" target="_blank">GitHub!</a>

                            MSJ Pokemon is A Non-Profit fan made Pok√©mon game. I am the only developer and worked on this during my High School days. This was a non-profit project
                            (meaning I did not publish this project publicly and did not ask for money on external sources) because I used copyrighted content. The word "Pokemon"
                            and the concept of pokemon with the game title screen and some game art are all created and owned by GameFreak and Nintendo. Please support the official release.

                    <p>You are going to the high school called Mount Saint Joseph High School, and you just realized you need all A's in order to graduate!'</p>

                    <p>
                        I made this game using RPGMaker XP plus an imported file called Pokemon Essentials! Pokemon Essentials delivers the needed assets in order to have a palete needed
                        for a full fledged pokemon game! I started this project around Sophomore year in high school. It took me until the end of my senior year to finish this game. Fun fact, the high
                        school you go to in the game is the same high school I went to. So all of the teachers in the game and many "Non-player characters" are real people. Their dialogue in the
                        game heavily reflects this. As I watch more and more people play through my masterpiece of a game, I realized that my creativity went through the roof while making these characters in the game.
                        Many people's favorite parts in the game are just walking around the school map and talking to the NPC's to see what kind of crazy or funny things would appear in the dialogue screen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the more technical parts of the game I used RPGMaker xp "block coding" style for NPC's and events. You still needed general coding knowledge in order to understand
                        the blocks when making events or dialogue. An example is "conditionals", which are like regular if-statements in object oriented programming. This type of programming was
                        needed since the first pokemon you pick at the beginning of the story reflects what pokemon your rival has throughout the game. These skills made the game feel unique to
                        players.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the more artistic parts of the game, I created a ton of assets needed to make the game. Every pokemon in the game was hand-drawn by me using a pixel-art program
                        called Piskel. Each sprite for a pokemon is 180x180 pixels. Each Pokemon also has a front, back, shiny front, and a shiny back sprite. This makes four needed 180x180 pixel
                        pictures. There is finally a smaller icon sprite that's needed for each Pokemon. As you can see, there is a ton of work for just one Pokemon. Overall, I made about 50 Pokemon
                        for the game. You can do the math for the amount of sprites needed for all of them. It was a lot!
                    </p>

                    <p>Final Stats for MSJ Pokemon: 294 MB Overall, 8,246 Files, 29 Folders, 50 Pokemon, 250+ Sprites, and 11 Hours of Minimum Gameplay.</p>

                        <p>PROJECT Dragon is a work in progress prototype game. I am the only developer and worked on this project after High School.</p>
                        <p>
                            PROJECT Dragon has been my most ambitious project yet. The game will force you to create your character and you would be thrown into this world and be forced to
                            survive, or do whatever you want to do. The main intriguing thing about the game is that survival is based on how strong (physically) you are in the game.
                            To survive well, you will need to train to become stronger. You would be able to face enemies, enter tournaments, and break your characters limits!

                        <p>
                            This prototype game was made in the game engine Unreal Engine 4. Unreal Engine 4 is one of the most powerful gaming engines out there and is pretty much industry standard
                            at this point in time. I learned how to utilize "Blueprint Programming", which was their point and drag way of connecting variables and commands.
                            <br />
                            I really got into graphics while making this prototype game. I used 4K models and have some cool pictures to show for it. I also made an entire example map
                            to show off some of the models.

                    <p>Garousome's World 2 is a minecraft mod made for the versions 1.16.4. I was the only developer. This mod was basically a port from version 1.7.10 to version 1.16.4.</p>
                    <p>
                        This mod adds a ton of new blocks into the world. Some examples are the Essence of Ethan and Essence of Garrett. You can mine these ores to get materials to help you craft
                        new items and new weapons! Note that this mod requires other mods in order to mine the best ore (requires a higher mining level).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another key feature of this mod is the addition of a lot of new music discs. Use new and existing minecraft materials to make new music discs and listen to
                        your favorite tunes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made this project using Java. Since Minecraft Java edition is also made in java, making a new .jar mod was not the hardest task to do. To check out the Source Code,
                        look at the GitHub section below.
